<img width="1044" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc2ffb75-92aa-4a6d-99c4-3a1fb1ba9ef9" />
Ever felt like your bank complaint was just another drop in the ocean? Our system helps banks hear you louder and clearer!"
Sometimes, the wait for a ticket resolution feels just like a long line at the bank. Our project aims to speed things up, even if it's just by giving us a heads-up.

 Features
 
Text Analysis: Dive deep into complaint narratives with advanced NLP processing.
Prediction Engine: Leverage a robust Logistic Regression model for accurate resolution predictions.
Probability Scores: Gain confidence with detailed probability scores for each prediction.
Batch Processing: Efficiently analyze multiple complaints simultaneously.
Real-time Predictions: Get instant insights on new complaints, empowering swift action.

Quick Start: Get It Running in No Time

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
pip package manager
NLTK data files (stopwords, wordnet, omw-1.4)

Installation

Clone the repository

Bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-complaint-prediction.git
cd bank-complaint-prediction
Create and activate your virtual environment

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install project dependencies

Bash

pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
Download NLTK essential data

Bash

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('wordnet'); nltk.download('omw-1.4')"
Training the Model (The Brains Learn)
Before making predictions, you need to train and save your model.

Bash

python save_model.py
Running the Web Application (Bringing It to Life!)
Once the model is trained, fire up the Flask application:

Bash

python app.py
Then, point your browser to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the prediction interface.

 User Interface
Here's a glimpse of the web interface where users can submit their bank complaints for prediction:




 Model Performance: How Smart Is It?
 
Our current Logistic Regression model is quite adept, achieving:
Accuracy: Approximately 85% on unseen test data.
Precision: 0.87 for correctly identifying "Solved" complaints.
Recall: 0.83 for capturing most of the actual "Solved" complaints.
F1-Score: An overall balanced 0.85.

This means our system is not just guessing; it's making informed decisions!

API Usage: Integrate with Ease

The Flask application exposes a user-friendly RESTful API for both single and batch predictions.
Single Complaint Prediction

Python

import requests

# Example complaint text
complaint_text = 'The bank charged unexpected fees on my account without notification. This is unacceptable.'

response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/predict',
                          json={'complaint': complaint_text})

print(response.json())
Batch Complaint Prediction
Python

import requests

complaints_list = [
    "Issue with mortgage payment processing, it's consistently late due to bank error.",
    "Unauthorized credit card transaction appeared on my statement, I did not make this purchase.",
    "Problem with online banking access, I cannot log in to view my accounts."
]

response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/batch_predict',
                          json={'complaints': complaints_list})

print(response.json())
üîÆ Prediction Results: What You Get
The API returns detailed predictions, including the predicted class, confidence level, and probabilities for each outcome:

JSON

{
  "prediction": "Solved",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "probabilities": {
    "solved": 0.87,
    "not_solved": 0.13
  }
}
 How It Works: The Workflow at a Glance
 
Text Preprocessing: We meticulously clean, tokenize, lemmatize, and remove stopwords from each complaint.
Feature Extraction: The cleaned text is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, capturing word importance and context (even with n-grams!).
Model Prediction: These features are fed into our trained Logistic Regression classifier, which makes its prediction.
Result Interpretation: The model's output is then translated into human-readable predictions, complete with confidence scores and probabilities.

 Data Source: Fueling the Intelligence
 
The backbone of our model's intelligence comes from the comprehensive CFPB Consumer Complaint Database. This treasure trove contains thousands of real-world banking complaints and their corresponding resolution statuses, allowing our model to learn from actual customer experiences.

 Acknowledgments
A huge shout-out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for making the invaluable complaint data publicly available.

Gratitude to the Scikit-learn and NLTK communities for their robust and well-documented libraries.

Thanks to all open-source contributors for maintaining the essential Python packages that make projects like this possible.

Note: This model is built for educational and demonstration purposes. While highly accurate, always validate its predictions with human domain experts and established business protocols before making critical operational decisions.
